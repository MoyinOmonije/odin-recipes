        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            With a sweet and savory honey-Dijon coating, these chicken tenders are a breeze to make. Serve them with ranch dressing, 
            ketchup, or more honey-mustard dressing.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>½ cup all-purpose flour, or as needed</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons honey</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>½ cup Italian-seasoned bread crumbs, or more as needed</li>
            <li>1 pound chicken tenders</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place flour in a shallow dish. Combine honey and Dijon mustard in another shallow dish. Place bread crumbs in a third shallow dish.</li>
            <li>
                Season chicken tenders with salt and black pepper. Dredge tenders in flour; shake off excess. Dip into honey-mustard mixture. Press into 
                bread crumbs to coat both sides, pressing crumbs into tenders. Place breaded tenders, unstacked, onto a plate. Repeat with remaining 
                tenders.
            </li>
            <li>
                Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet. Add tenders; cook until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Carefully flip tenders, add 
                remaining 1 tablespoon butter, cook until chicken is fully cooked and golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes more.
            </li>
        </ol>
